        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>From a young age, I've been deeply rooted in the bustling environment of my family's restaurant, where I've been working since I was 14. Balancing trays and customer service with schoolwork, I also found passion and camaraderie on the football and baseball fields, embodying teamwork and discipline. My high school sweetheart has been my rock through it all, sharing six incredible years of growth and love. Our two dogs, a spirited mix of pit bull and blue healer along with a lively Jack Russell terrier, fill our lives with joy and endless energy. Currently, I'm navigating the challenges of a computer science degree, driven by a fascination with technology and its potential to shape the future. My free time is spent hiking through nature's tranquility, exploring new destinations, and dreaming of the places we'll travel to next. With every step, I'm committed to building a successful career, fueled by the experiences that have shaped me and the dreams that propel me forward.</p>
        <p>The following video is one given by Denzel Washington at a graduation for UOP. His speech has certainly shaped my outlook on education and has helped form my determination for success.</p>
